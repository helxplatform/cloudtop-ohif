This directory contains the Dockerfile and a small amount of code needed to build the CloudTop-Ohif docker that adds the Google Helath enable OHIF viewer to the CloudTop base image.  The only files needed are the Dockerfile and a run file that instructs the S6 process monitoring implementation to start and monitor the nginx server.
